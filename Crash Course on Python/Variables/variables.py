Learning About Variables...

''' 

# Variables: Names that we give to certain values in our programs.
# Values can be of ANY data type.
# Variables are just containers for data; computer holds data in memory for use later. 

length = 10

wdith = 2

area = length * width

print(area)

# Assignment: The process of storing a value inside of a variable

# Expression: A combination of number, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated

# Variable = Value

'''
Variable Naming Restrictions...

- Don't use keywords or functions that PYthon reserves for it's own use. 

- Don't use spaces

- Must start with a letter or underscore

- Must be made up of only:

    - Letters
    - Numbers
    - Underscores

Valid Variables:

i_am_a_variable --> Valid

i_am_a_variable2 --> valid

1_is_a_numver --> invalid # Cannot start with a number!

apples_&_oranges --> invalid # Cannot use a special character!

Variables are case sensitive...
